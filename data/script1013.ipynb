Introduction and My Personal Experience \n\nKiva is a non-profit micro-funding/loan capitalization website.  Users from around the world come to lend money to those in need around the world.  Often these loans are for small entrepeneurs.  Kiva lenders receive no return on capital and are subject to loan defaults and currency exchange losses.  Loans are distributed by Kiva field partners to borrowers to improve their lives and help facilitiate their growth out of poverty.  Kiva field partner lenders do charge a local market interest rate.  Kiva funders insure capital is available and loans have funding to be made.  The default rate for these loans is very low in comparison [to other default rates](https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/chargeoff/delallsa.htm).  If you have never used it I [invite you to give it a try!](https://www.kiva.org/invitedby/mikedev10)  17.8% of my loans were to the Philippines, I worked there a few weeks in 2003 and have worked from there in January 2016/17/18 ditching the Chicago winter.  Kiva users will find the Philippines and women come up often in the data, likely even more often in my own as I made a conscious effort to lend to both.  For a long time I only lent to women.  I also like groups.  I lend heavily more towards business type use vs. personal investment or personal use.\n\n![](https://www.doyouevendata.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/kiva.jpg)"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"03d4c398-b5fd-4cbb-8bac-efc9bcd25afe","_uuid":"a79468d366613715d1f70505d410e01c23b89e81"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=approach></a>\n## 1.1 Approach (Data and Visual) \n\nI'm willing to bet my approach is not the best in regards to best practices in working with data, probably in part due to memory usage.  However I'm looking to make my life easier here and the dataset all fits, so we're going to roll with it.  I've attempted to tie kiva provided data together as best I can, along with additional MPI data to get a richer view of the areas and how they experience poverty, to create one large set to work with.

I've included a loan count for currencies that are used in 2 or more countries.  However sometimes this only meant a single loan, and the graph was big.  I only ended up plotting those countries which have had loans in multiple currencies where their were more than 20 loans in a currency.  ILS and JOD (Israel and Jordan) thus only show one bar, although in Palestine < 20 loans in each currency was lent (4 and 8, respecitively).  Developing countries sometimes end up with monetary systems pegged to more stable countries or straight out use the money of those countries as a result of lack of trust or poor management of their state currency.  Some notes:\n1. The *Central African CFA Franc* **XAF** is pegged to the Euro at 1 Euro = 655.957 XAF. It is the currency for six independent states in central Africa: Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea and Gabon.\n2. The *West African CFA Franc* **XOF** is pegged the same way.  It is the currency for Benin, Burkina Faso, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Mali, Niger, Senegal, and Togo.\n3. The following countries outside the US *only* use **USD**: Ecuador, East Timor, El Salvador, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Palau, Turks and Caicos, British Virgin Islands, and Zimbabwe.  Cambodia has the Cambodien Riel (KHR) however foreign debit cards disburse USD at ATMs, and 90% of the country uses US Dollars, with the local currency generally used for change or anything worth less than a dollar.  We can see the vast amount of Palestine's loan counts are in USD as well.\n4.

This means the currency was actually gaining purchasing power.  This seems to account for the decline in USD and rise in LBP.  It is curious as to who is making the distinction, ie. were borrowers asking for LBP or were field partners offering/pushing it?  Inflation is more of the borrower's friend than deflation - the borrower would likely not reap any benefits of increased purchasing power as they are likely borrowing to buy something right away.  Inflation, however, means the borrower is paying back their loan with \"cheaper\" currency in that the currency now has less purchasing power.  In theory the interest rate the money is lent at accounts for both a small profit for the field partner as well as a factor to hedge against inflation risk.

Current Poverty Targeting System\nAnnalie has a good kernel on the [current targeting system](https://www.kaggle.com/annalie/kivampi), with a good follow up by Elliott [here](https://www.kaggle.com/elliottc/kivampi).  Annalie provides an additional metric for financial inclusion [here](https://www.kaggle.com/annalie/metric-for-financial-inclusion).  Overall I think their metrics and approaches sound very good and are challenging to improve upon, particularly because most readily available statistics or data are at the country level, while it seems the most value would be derived in digging deeper into regional or much more local levels for field partners and borrowers.  On top of that, we are generally working with countries that would be among the most challenging to get this type of data from.  Aside from more local/accurate data, there's also a challenge in placing the lender in the correct local area, should that information even be available.\n\nThings to keep in mind: higher MPI = generally poorer area across the multiple dimensions MPI tries to represent.  We're working with blended MPI data provided at the National as well as administrative regions (Sub-National) within a country; Kiva is looking to improve their accuracy using this data and other external datasets to really understand their borrowers and to make sure limited efforts and funds are being routed to where they can best serve people.  The brunt of this section is looking at current MPI calculations and how they might be improved.\n\n![](http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/mpi.png)\n\n<a id=curr_nat_mpi></a>\n## 12.1 Current Kiva Scoring - National MPI\nPer the above referenced kernels, \n\n\"**Nation-level MPI Scores** are broken into rural and urban scores. So Kiva's broadest measure simply assigns each field partner an average of these two numbers, weighted by rural_pct. About a dozen field partners also serve multiple countries, in which case we take a volume-weighted average.\"\n\n**NOT** taking into account Field Partner scores that go across multiple countries, let's take a look at Mozambique (MOZ) scores using the existing methodology.

MPI Nat Calc is very close to MPI National - close enough to argue the same methodology may very well produce this value, with the difference simply being that rural percentage from another year was used.\n2.

Maputo is the capital of Mozambique and a [pretty urban appearing area](https://www.google.co.th/maps/place/Maputo,+Mozambique/@-25.8962418,32.5406432,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x1ee69723b666da55:0x42497f579a6bb442!8m2!3d-25.969248!4d32.5731746); yet the field partner stating 85% of loans were rural in the region is registering a quite large 0.43635 for the area; even the one with 20% is hitting 0.2472.  These are high numbers in comparison to not only MPI National and even MPI Urban rates for the region, but in fact very high compared to the supplied MPI Regional rate of a much much lower 0.043.

So I think a fundamental question to pose - which I don't have an answer for - is should we weight by people/loans or by dollars?  Dollars are absolutely understandable - but it seems arguable that number of lives touched would make a good metric too.  Note the logic by counting loans/people is a little more in line with the rural_percentage methodology used today as well, as it is strictly focusing on the number and location of borrowers, regardless of the amount.\n\n<a id=13></a>\n# 13.
