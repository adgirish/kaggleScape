# **This best starting point for most users is [Kaggle Learn](https://www.kaggle.com/learn)**.  This list you are viewing is from before Kaggle Learn was launched, but it is now out-of-date. **[Go here](https://www.kaggle.com/learn)** for the best and most up-to-date resource about learning data science on Kaggle.
# 
# # Overview
# Want to get started with Machine Learning? In this series, you will quickly get up to speed building your first machine learning model. You will then progress through a series of improvements, until you have everything you need to build great models.
# 
# - ** Pre-Requisites: ** Basic Python programming expertise <br>
# - ** Getting Started: ** Go through the tutorials listed below, starting at the top. After the first tutorial, you will be start coding. Your code runs online, so you won't need to download any software or do any set-up on your local computer. 
# 
# *Later tutorials build on code you write in the earlier tutorials. So most users are better off starting from the beginning.*
