They are as follows:\n", "\n", "1. **Simple Recommender:** This system used overall TMDB Vote Count and Vote Averages to build Top Movies Charts, in general and for a specific genre. The IMDB Weighted Rating System was used to calculate ratings on which the sorting was finally performed.\n", "2. **Content Based Recommender:** We built two content based engines; one that took movie overview and taglines as input and the other which took metadata such as cast, crew, genre and keywords to come up with predictions. We also deviced a simple filter to give greater preference to movies with more votes and higher ratings.\n", "3. **Collaborative Filtering:** We used the powerful Surprise Library to build a collaborative filter based on single value decomposition. The RMSE obtained was less than 1 and the engine gave estimated ratings for a given user and movie.\n", "4. **Hybrid Engine:** We brought together ideas from content and collaborative filterting to build an engine that gave movie suggestions to a particular user based on the estimated ratings that it had internally calculated for that user.\n", "\n", "Previous -> [The Story of Film](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-story-of-film/)"], "metadata": {"_uuid": "ad1edcae8eecd5c725edbe18082bc4d8103ca800", "_cell_guid": "812fc4c7-b334-4f54-a05f-8fc0e7962a92"}, "cell_type": "markdown"}, {"outputs": [], "execution_count": null, "source": [], "metadata": {"_uuid": "e53889f19f6d352bb0418567941dff8f9e57da41", "_cell_guid": "304b0809-4070-4954-99ed-203a4b8b6956", "collapsed": true}, "cell_type": "code"}], "nbformat_minor": 1, "nbformat": 4, "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "file_extension": ".py", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "version": "3.6.3"}}}
