Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles for short trips, typically 30 minutes or less. With the latest technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.\n","\n","In this project, we will perform an exploratory analysis on data provided by [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/), a bike-share system provider for many major cities in the United States. We will compare the system usage between three large cities: New York City, Chicago, and Washington, DC. We will also see if there are any differences within each system for those users that are registered, regular users and those users that are short-term, casual users."],"cell_type":"markdown"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"86090bd97073eabe79b27ae7fed2812a35b1f327","_cell_guid":"73e9392f-6a25-463c-91e5-94c052bb8940"},"source":["<a id='pose_questions'></a>\n","## Posing Questions\n","\n","Before looking at the bike sharing data, rather any data, we should start by asking questions we might want to understand about the bike share data. Consider, for example, if we were working for Motivate. What kinds of information would we want to know about in order to make smarter business decisions? Also, if we are a user of the bike-share service, what factors might influence how we would want to use the service?\n","\n","Below are the questions that could be asked by someone who is working for Motivate:\n","\n","1. What are the Stations with high usage rate.\n","2. What is the average trip duration.\n","3. Who are the users with high trip duration.\n","4. What is the Age Group of users with high usage.\n","5. Stations with high Registered users.\n","\n","Below are the questions that could be asked by someone who is using the services of Motivate:\n","\n","1.

In this project, we will focus on the record of individual trips taken in 2016 from our selected cities: New York City, Chicago, and Washington, DC. Each of these cities has a page where we can freely download the trip data.:\n","\n","- New York City (Citi Bike): [Link](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data)\n","- Chicago (Divvy): [Link](https://www.divvybikes.com/system-data)\n","- Washington, DC (Capital Bikeshare): [Link](https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/system-data)\n","\n","If you visit these pages, you will notice that each city has a different way of delivering its data. Chicago updates with new data twice a year, Washington DC is quarterly, and New York City is monthly. Note that some data wrangling of inconsistencies in timestamp format within each city has already been performed and a random 2% sample of the original data is taken to make the exploration more manageable. However, there is still a lot of data for us to investigate."],"cell_type":"markdown"},{"outputs":[],"metadata":{"collapsed":true,"_cell_guid":"f44e158d-5279-4ec1-9faf-2d984237a482","_uuid":"a11e678b043dd75fc5e9013c6d2e104738c1815b","scrolled":false},"source":["## import all necessary packages and functions.\n","import csv # read and write csv files\n","from datetime import datetime # operations to parse dates\n","from pprint import pprint # use to print data structures like dictionaries in\n","                          # a nicer way than the base print function."],"execution_count":null,"cell_type":"code"},{"outputs":[],"metadata":{"collapsed":true,"_cell_guid":"35723e01-7712-489c-ad7d-4eeea553a833","_uuid":"7c851120fa640d6745407ef84d7486f9efacf30d","scrolled":false},"source":["def print_first_point(filename):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    This function prints and returns the first data point (second row) from\n","    a csv file that includes a header row.\n","    \"\"\"\n","    # print city name for reference\n","    city = filename.split('-')[0].split('/')[-1]\n","    print('\\nCity: {}'.format(city))\n","    \n","    with open(filename, 'r') as f_in:\n","        ## Use the csv library to set up a DictReader object. ##\n","        ## see https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html           ##\n","        trip_reader = csv.DictReader(f_in)\n","        \n","        ## Use a function on the DictReader object to read the     ##\n","        ## first trip from the data file and store it in a variable.     ##\n","        ## see https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#reader-objects ##\n","        first_trip = trip_reader.__next__()\n","        \n","        ## Use the pprint library to print the first trip. ##\n","        ## see https://docs.python.org/3/library/pprint.html     ##\n","        pprint(first_trip)\n","        \n","    # output city name and first trip for later testing\n","    return (city, first_trip)\n","\n","# list of files for each city\n","data_files = ['../input/NYC-CitiBike-2016.csv',\n","              '../input/Chicago-Divvy-2016.csv',\n","              '../input/Washington-CapitalBikeshare-2016.csv',]\n","\n","# print the first trip from each file, store in dictionary\n","example_trips = {}\n","for data_file in data_files:\n","    city, first_trip = print_first_point(data_file)\n","    example_trips[city] = first_trip"],"execution_count":null,"cell_type":"code"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"482e24cde5146560f08b5cc62fe627887e73a7c6","_cell_guid":"a8f6661e-e61f-45a9-9d51-a0b9cbf2ef27"},"source":["<a id='condensing'></a>\n","### Condensing the Trip Data\n","\n","It should also be observable from the above printout that each city provides different information. Even where the information is the same, the column names and formats are sometimes different. To make things as simple as possible when we get to the actual exploration, we should trim and clean the data. Cleaning the data makes sure that the data formats across the cities are consistent, while trimming focuses only on the parts of the data we are most interested in to make the exploration easier to work with.\n","\n","Below, we will generate new data files with five values of interest for each trip: trip duration, starting month, starting hour, day of the week, and user type. Each of these may require additional wrangling depending on the city:\n","\n","- **Duration**: This has been given to us in seconds (New York, Chicago) or milliseconds (Washington). A more natural unit of analysis will be if all the trip durations are given in terms of minutes.\n","- **Month**, **Hour**, **Day of Week**: Ridership volume is likely to change based on the season, time of day, and whether it is a weekday or weekend. Use the start time of the trip to obtain these values. The New York City data includes the seconds in their timestamps, while Washington and Chicago do not. The [`datetime`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html) package will be very useful here to make the needed conversions.\n","- **User Type**: It is possible that users who are subscribed to a bike-share system will have different patterns of use compared to users who only have temporary passes. Washington divides its users into two types: 'Registered' for users with annual, monthly, and other longer-term subscriptions, and 'Casual', for users with 24-hour, 3-day, and other short-term passes. The New York and Chicago data uses 'Subscriber' and 'Customer' for these groups, respectively. For consistency, we will convert the Washington labels to match the other two."],"cell_type":"markdown"},{"outputs":[],"metadata":{"collapsed":true,"_cell_guid":"40af48e7-d7e4-45c3-9e5c-b7a0ca45842b","_uuid":"903d478afe894518ba1ff666beeb4fa3f6d312c8","scrolled":false},"source":["def duration_in_mins(datum, city):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Takes as input a dictionary containing info about a single trip (datum) and\n","    its origin city (city) and returns the trip duration in units of minutes.\n","    \n","    Remember that Washington is in terms of milliseconds while Chicago and NYC\n","    are in terms of seconds. \n","    \n","    HINT: The csv module reads in all of the data as strings, including numeric\n","    values.
