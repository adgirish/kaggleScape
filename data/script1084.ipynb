For many databases out there, SQL is the *only* way to access the information in them and, as a result, it's an important skill for any data scientist or aspiring data scientist. (You don't need to take my word on this one: in our survey of data scientists we found that SQL was [the third most popular software tool for data science](https://www.kaggle.com/surveys/2017), right after Python and R.)\n\n> **Why learn SQL?**: If you're currently looking for a data science job, being able to show that you're comfortable with SQL will open up more job opportunities for you. If you're currently *doing* data science, brushing up on your SQL skills will help you access more data sources and make it easier to get a subset of a database to work with locally. Plus, it's fun! :)\n\n[BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/) is a Google Cloud product for storing and accessing very large databases very quickly. We've recently started making [some BigQuery datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?filetype=bigQuery) accessible via Kaggle. Since SQL is the easiest way to access these data in these datasets they make the perfect playground to help you get comfortable with this language.\n\n>  Because the datasets on BigQuery can be very large, there are some restrictions on how much data you can access. The good news is that **each Kaggle user can scan 5TB every 30 days for free.** The bad news is that If you go over your quota you're going to have to wait for it to reset. \n\nDon't worry, though: in this handbook we'll teach you how to be careful when looking at BigQuery data to make sure you don't accidentally go over your quota.","outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"60b8852ab5bbb0f2fa2b6763a55af3df9ef34fc4","_cell_guid":"644250cf-5b27-4ca6-9502-bc6ee21c5eea"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# How to use BigQuery datasets in kernels\n____\n\nIn this section, we're going to go through how to get your first BigQuery notebook up and running and how to actually run a query. I'm going to cover:\n\n* Getting your notebook set up\n* Checking the structure of the dataset (to help you when you want to write queries)\n* How to check the size of a query before you run it (to avoid accidentally asking for waaaay more data than you wanted)\n* How to run your first query! \n* How to save the data from your query as a .csv to use later\n\nI'm *not* going to cover all the intricacies of SQL. That's what the next five days of the Scavenger Hunt are for!\n\n## Getting set up\n___\nThe first step is to start a kernel using one of the BigQuery datasets as the data source. You can find these datasets by going to the [Datasets page](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) and selecting \"BigQuery\" from the \"File Types\" drop down menu at the top of the list of datasets. (Alternatively, you can follow [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?filetype=bigQuery).) \n\nOnce you've picked a BigQuery dataset, head to the dataset page for it and start a new kernel on it by hitting the \"New Kernel\" button, just as you would with any other dataset. Right now, you can only use BigQuery databases with Python kernels.\n\n> **Can you work with BigQuery in R kernels?** Right now, you can only work with BigQuery in Python kernels, so make sure you don't accidentally start an R kernel instead. If you want to do your analysis in R (which is my personal preference) you can save the data you query as an output file and then add that to a new kernel. We'll go over how to do that later in this notebook. :)\n\nIn order to make your life easier, we've put together a Python package called `bq_helper` and pre-loaded it into kernels. It has some helper functions for getting data out of BigQuery that will simplify the process of getting data. If you're curious, you can check out [example kernels with more in-depth information at the end of this notebook](#Additional-information-and-resources).\n\nYou can use `bq_helper` in your kernel by importing it, like so:","outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"40c48abc24d59a32b0a2156e60dfb7a808081926","collapsed":true,"_cell_guid":"0077123a-0f36-4f70-a935-fd058ce7f549","trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"# import our bq_helper package\nimport bq_helper ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"c29680f779f0bdb6985c3c63af4d71ef7451d6c2","_cell_guid":"cd0dd08a-232d-4b3c-bf12-813ee652f5de"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now that we've added a BigQuery package to our kernel and imported the helper package, the next step is to create a BigQueryHelper object that points to a specific dataset. \n\nThe first thing we need to do this is to know is what our specific dataset is called.

For example, [here's a link to the Data tab of the Hacker News dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/hacker-news/hacker-news/data), which is what we're going to be using in this kernel.\n\nIf you go to the link I provided, you'll notice a blue rectangle with rounded edges near the top of the page that has the following text in it: \"bigquery-public-data.hacker_news.comments\".

The addresses of BigQuery datasets look like this:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/l11gdKx.png)\n\nWe will need to pass this information to BigQueryHelper in order to create our helper object.

Until working at a bigger scale suddenly it makes your problems bigger too, like [this poor professor whose experiment racked up an unexpected $1000 bill](https://www.wired.com/2012/04/aws-bill-in-minutes/). Although Kaggle isn't charging for accessing BigQuery datasets, following these best practices can help you avoid trouble down the line. If you'd like to learn more, you can check out [all the BigQuery best practices here](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/best-practices).\n\n* *Avoid using the asterisk *(**) in your queries.* As you might have seen before in regular expressions, the asterisk means “everything”. While this may be okay with smaller datasets, if you send a query to a 4 terabyte dataset and ask for “everything” you're going to scan waaaaay more than you bargained for (or that a kernel can handle).\n* *For initial exploration, look at just part of the table instead of the whole thing.* If you're just curious to see what data's in a table, preview it instead of scanning the whole table. We've included a method, `BigQueryHelper.head()`, in our helper package to help with this. Like `head()` in Pandas or R, it will just return the first few rows for you to look at.\n* *Double-check the size of complex queries.* If you're planning on running what might be a large query, either estimate the size first or run it using the `BigQueryHelper.query_to_pandas_safe()` method.\n* *Be cautious about joining tables.* In particular, avoid joining a table with itself (i.e. a self-join) and try to avoid joins that return a table that's larger than the ones you're joining together. (If you want to double-check yourself, you can try the join on just the heads of the tables involved.)\n* *Don't rely on LIMIT*: One of the things that can be confusing when working with BigQuery datasets is the difference between the data you *scan* and the data you actually *get back* especially since it's the first one that actually counts against your quota. When you do something like select a column with LIMIT = 10, you'll only get 10 results back... but you'll actually be scanning the whole column.
