# The public kernals are filled with Blends of Blends of Blends and maybe someone can blend to 1.00000 too. 
# 
# Ok, Nothing wrong in that. I just thought good solid kernals should not be lost within the chaos.  
# 
# So, I've compiled and categorized a list of resources that have taught something to me. Please add on to this list in the comments below, if I've missed any good kernals.
# 
# ### Simple Naive-Bayes:

# ### Tf-IDF and simple Logistic Regression:
# 
# * https://www.kaggle.com/tunguz/logistic-regression-with-words-and-char-n-grams            # ngram range=(2,6)   -->    can capture a lot of information!
