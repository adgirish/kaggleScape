# # Approaching (Almost) Any NLP Problem on Kaggle
# 
# In this post I'll talk about approaching natural language processing problems on Kaggle. As an example, we will use the data from this competition. We will create a very basic first model first and then improve it using different other features. We will also see how deep neural networks can be used and end this post with some ideas about ensembling in general.
# 
# ### This covers:
# - tfidf 
# - count features
# - logistic regression
# - naive bayes
# - svm
# - xgboost
# - grid search
# - word vectors
# - LSTM
# - GRU
# - Ensembling
# 
# *NOTE*: This notebook is not meant for achieving a very high score on the Leaderboard for this dataset. However, if you follow it properly, you can get a very high score with some tuning. ;)
# 
# So, without wasting any time, let's start with importing some important python modules that I'll be using.

# The problem requires us to predict the author, i.e. EAP, HPL and MWS given the text. In simpler words, text classification with 3 different classes.

# For this particular problem, Kaggle has specified multi-class log-loss as evaluation metric. This is implemented in the follow way (taken from: https://github.com/dnouri/nolearn/blob/master/nolearn/lasagne/util.py)

# ## Building Basic Models
# 
# Let's start building our very first model. 
# 
# Our very first model is a simple TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency) followed by a simple Logistic Regression.

# In[ ]:


# Always start with these features. They work (almost) everytime!
tfv = TfidfVectorizer(min_df=3,  max_features=None, 
            strip_accents='unicode', analyzer='word',token_pattern=r'\w{1,}',
            ngram_range=(1, 3), use_idf=1,smooth_idf=1,sublinear_tf=1,
            stop_words = 'english')

# Fitting TF-IDF to both training and test sets (semi-supervised learning)
tfv.fit(list(xtrain) + list(xvalid))
xtrain_tfv =  tfv.transform(xtrain) 
xvalid_tfv = tfv.transform(xvalid)


# In[ ]:


# Fitting a simple Logistic Regression on TFIDF
clf = LogisticRegression(C=1.0)
clf.fit(xtrain_tfv, ytrain)
predictions = clf.predict_proba(xvalid_tfv)

print ("logloss: %0.3f " % multiclass_logloss(yvalid, predictions))


# And there we go. We have our first model with a multiclass logloss of 0.626.
# 
# But we are greedy and want a better score. Lets look at the same model with a different data.
# 
# Instead of using TF-IDF, we can also use word counts as features. This can be done easily using CountVectorizer from scikit-learn.

# In[ ]:


ctv = CountVectorizer(analyzer='word',token_pattern=r'\w{1,}',
            ngram_range=(1, 3), stop_words = 'english')

# Fitting Count Vectorizer to both training and test sets (semi-supervised learning)
ctv.fit(list(xtrain) + list(xvalid))
xtrain_ctv =  ctv.transform(xtrain) 
xvalid_ctv = ctv.transform(xvalid)


# In[ ]:


# Fitting a simple Logistic Regression on Counts
clf = LogisticRegression(C=1.0)
clf.fit(xtrain_ctv, ytrain)
predictions = clf.predict_proba(xvalid_ctv)

print ("logloss: %0.3f " % multiclass_logloss(yvalid, predictions))


# Aaaaanddddddd Wallah! We just improved our first model by 0.1!!!
# 
# Next, let's try a very simple model which was quite famous in ancient times - Naive Bayes.
# 
# Let's see what happens when we use naive bayes on these two datasets:

# In[ ]:


# Fitting a simple Naive Bayes on TFIDF
clf = MultinomialNB()
clf.fit(xtrain_tfv, ytrain)
predictions = clf.predict_proba(xvalid_tfv)

print ("logloss: %0.3f " % multiclass_logloss(yvalid, predictions))


# Good performance! But the logistic regression on counts is still better! What happens when we use this model on counts data instead?

# In[ ]:


# Fitting a simple Naive Bayes on Counts
clf = MultinomialNB()
clf.fit(xtrain_ctv, ytrain)
predictions = clf.predict_proba(xvalid_ctv)

print ("logloss: %0.3f " % multiclass_logloss(yvalid, predictions))


# Whoa! Seems like old stuff still works good!!!! One more ancient algorithms in the list is SVMs. Some people "love" SVMs. So, we must try SVM on this dataset.
# 
# Since SVMs take a lot of time, we will reduce the number of features from the TF-IDF using Singular Value Decomposition before applying SVM. 
# 
# Also, note that before applying SVMs, we *must* standardize the data.

# In[ ]:


# Apply SVD, I chose 120 components. 120-200 components are good enough for SVM model.
svd = decomposition.TruncatedSVD(n_components=120)
svd.fit(xtrain_tfv)
xtrain_svd = svd.transform(xtrain_tfv)
xvalid_svd = svd.transform(xvalid_tfv)

# Scale the data obtained from SVD. Renaming variable to reuse without scaling.
scl = preprocessing.StandardScaler()
scl.fit(xtrain_svd)
xtrain_svd_scl = scl.transform(xtrain_svd)
xvalid_svd_scl = scl.transform(xvalid_svd)


# Now it's time to apply SVM. After running the following cell, feel free to go for a walk or talk to your girlfriend/boyfriend. :P

# In[ ]:


# Fitting a simple SVM
clf = SVC(C=1.0, probability=True) # since we need probabilities
clf.fit(xtrain_svd_scl, ytrain)
predictions = clf.predict_proba(xvalid_svd_scl)

print ("logloss: %0.3f " % multiclass_logloss(yvalid, predictions))


# Oops! time to get up! Looks like SVM doesn't perform well on this data...! 
# 
# Before moving further, lets apply the most popular algorithm on Kaggle: xgboost!

# In[ ]:


# Fitting a simple xgboost on tf-idf
clf = xgb.XGBClassifier(max_depth=7, n_estimators=200, colsample_bytree=0.8, 
                        subsample=0.8, nthread=10, learning_rate=0.1)
clf.fit(xtrain_tfv.tocsc(), ytrain)
predictions = clf.predict_proba(xvalid_tfv.tocsc())

print ("logloss: %0.3f " % multiclass_logloss(yvalid, predictions))


# In[ ]:


# Fitting a simple xgboost on tf-idf
clf = xgb.XGBClassifier(max_depth=7, n_estimators=200, colsample_bytree=0.8, 
                        subsample=0.8, nthread=10, learning_rate=0.1)
clf.fit(xtrain_ctv.tocsc(), ytrain)
predictions = clf.predict_proba(xvalid_ctv.tocsc())

print ("logloss: %0.3f " % multiclass_logloss(yvalid, predictions))


# In[ ]:


# Fitting a simple xgboost on tf-idf svd features
clf = xgb.XGBClassifier(max_depth=7, n_estimators=200, colsample_bytree=0.8, 
                        subsample=0.8, nthread=10, learning_rate=0.1)
clf.fit(xtrain_svd, ytrain)
predictions = clf.predict_proba(xvalid_svd)

print ("logloss: %0.3f " % multiclass_logloss(yvalid, predictions))


# In[ ]:


# Fitting a simple xgboost on tf-idf svd features
clf = xgb.XGBClassifier(nthread=10)
clf.fit(xtrain_svd, ytrain)
predictions = clf.predict_proba(xvalid_svd)

print ("logloss: %0.3f " % multiclass_logloss(yvalid, predictions))


# Seems like no luck with XGBoost! But that is not correct. I haven't done any hyperparameter optimizations yet. And since I'm lazy, I'll just tell you how to do it and you can do it on your own! ;). This will be discussed in the next section:
# 
# 
# ## Grid Search
# 
# Its a technique for hyperparameter optimization. Not so effective but can give good results if you know the grid you want to use. I specify the parameters that should usually be used in this post: http://blog.kaggle.com/2016/07/21/approaching-almost-any-machine-learning-problem-abhishek-thakur/ Please keep in mind that these are the parameters I usually use. There are many other methods of hyperparameter optimization which may or may not be as effective.
# 
# In this section, I'll talk about grid search using logistic regression. 
# 
# Before starting with grid search we need to create a scoring function. This is accomplished using the `make_scorer` function of scikit-learn.
# 

# In[ ]:


mll_scorer = metrics.make_scorer(multiclass_logloss, greater_is_better=False, needs_proba=True)


# Next we need a pipeline. For demonstration here, i'll be using a pipeline consisting of SVD, scaling and then logistic regression. Its better to understand with more modules in pipeline than just one ;)

# In[ ]:


# Initialize SVD
svd = TruncatedSVD()
    
# Initialize the standard scaler 
scl = preprocessing.StandardScaler()

# We will use logistic regression here..
lr_model = LogisticRegression()

# Create the pipeline 
clf = pipeline.Pipeline([('svd', svd),
                         ('scl', scl),
                         ('lr', lr_model)])


# Next we need a grid of parameters:

# In[ ]:


param_grid = {'svd__n_components' : [120, 180],
              'lr__C': [0.1, 1.0, 10], 
              'lr__penalty': ['l1', 'l2']}


# So, for SVD we evaluate 120 and 180 components and for logistic regression we evaluate three different values of C with l1 and l2 penalty. We can now start grid search on these parameters.

# In[ ]:


# Initialize Grid Search Model
model = GridSearchCV(estimator=clf, param_grid=param_grid, scoring=mll_scorer,
                                 verbose=10, n_jobs=-1, iid=True, refit=True, cv=2)

# Fit Grid Search Model
model.fit(xtrain_tfv, ytrain)  # we can use the full data here but im only using xtrain
print("Best score: %0.3f" % model.best_score_)
print("Best parameters set:")
best_parameters = model.best_estimator_.get_params()
for param_name in sorted(param_grid.keys()):
    print("\t%s: %r" % (param_name, best_parameters[param_name]))


# The score comes similar to what we had for SVM. This technique can be used to finetune xgboost or even multinomial naive bayes as below. We will use the tfidf data here:

# In[ ]:


nb_model = MultinomialNB()

# Create the pipeline 
clf = pipeline.Pipeline([('nb', nb_model)])

# parameter grid
param_grid = {'nb__alpha': [0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100]}

# Initialize Grid Search Model
model = GridSearchCV(estimator=clf, param_grid=param_grid, scoring=mll_scorer,
                                 verbose=10, n_jobs=-1, iid=True, refit=True, cv=2)

# Fit Grid Search Model
model.fit(xtrain_tfv, ytrain)  # we can use the full data here but im only using xtrain. 
print("Best score: %0.3f" % model.best_score_)
print("Best parameters set:")
best_parameters = model.best_estimator_.get_params()
for param_name in sorted(param_grid.keys()):
    print("\t%s: %r" % (param_name, best_parameters[param_name]))


# This is an improvement of 8% over the original naive bayes score!
# 
# In NLP problems, it's customary to look at word vectors. Word vectors give a lot of insights about the data. Let's dive into that.
# 
# ## Word Vectors
# 
# Without going into too much details, I would explain how to create sentence vectors and how can we use them to create a machine learning model on top of it. I am a fan of GloVe vectors, word2vec and fasttext. In this post, I'll be using the GloVe vectors. You can download the GloVe vectors from here `http://www-nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.840B.300d.zip`

# In[ ]:


# load the GloVe vectors in a dictionary:

embeddings_index = {}
f = open('glove.840B.300d.txt')
for line in tqdm(f):
    values = line.split()
    word = values[0]
    coefs = np.asarray(values[1:], dtype='float32')
    embeddings_index[word] = coefs
f.close()

print('Found %s word vectors.' % len(embeddings_index))


# In[ ]:


# this function creates a normalized vector for the whole sentence
def sent2vec(s):
    words = str(s).lower().decode('utf-8')
    words = word_tokenize(words)
    words = [w for w in words if not w in stop_words]
    words = [w for w in words if w.isalpha()]
    M = []
    for w in words:
        try:
            M.append(embeddings_index[w])
        except:
            continue
    M = np.array(M)
    v = M.sum(axis=0)
    if type(v) != np.ndarray:
        return np.zeros(300)
    return v / np.sqrt((v ** 2).sum())


# In[ ]:


# create sentence vectors using the above function for training and validation set
xtrain_glove = [sent2vec(x) for x in tqdm(xtrain)]
xvalid_glove = [sent2vec(x) for x in tqdm(xvalid)]


# In[ ]:


xtrain_glove = np.array(xtrain_glove)
xvalid_glove = np.array(xvalid_glove)


# Let's see the performance of xgboost on glove features:

# In[ ]:


# Fitting a simple xgboost on glove features
clf = xgb.XGBClassifier(nthread=10, silent=False)
clf.fit(xtrain_glove, ytrain)
predictions = clf.predict_proba(xvalid_glove)

print ("logloss: %0.3f " % multiclass_logloss(yvalid, predictions))


# In[ ]:


# Fitting a simple xgboost on glove features
clf = xgb.XGBClassifier(max_depth=7, n_estimators=200, colsample_bytree=0.8, 
                        subsample=0.8, nthread=10, learning_rate=0.1, silent=False)
clf.fit(xtrain_glove, ytrain)
predictions = clf.predict_proba(xvalid_glove)

print ("logloss: %0.3f " % multiclass_logloss(yvalid, predictions))


# we see that a simple tuning of parameters can improve xgboost score on GloVe features! Believe me you can squeeze a lot more from it.
# 
# ## Deep Learning
# 
# But this is an era of deep learning! We cant live without training a few neural networks. Here, we will train LSTM and a simple dense network on the GloVe features. Let's start with the dense network first:

# In[ ]:


# scale the data before any neural net:
scl = preprocessing.StandardScaler()
xtrain_glove_scl = scl.fit_transform(xtrain_glove)
xvalid_glove_scl = scl.transform(xvalid_glove)


# In[ ]:


# we need to binarize the labels for the neural net
ytrain_enc = np_utils.to_categorical(ytrain)
yvalid_enc = np_utils.to_categorical(yvalid)


# In[ ]:


# create a simple 3 layer sequential neural net
model = Sequential()

model.add(Dense(300, input_dim=300, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dropout(0.2))
model.add(BatchNormalization())

model.add(Dense(300, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dropout(0.3))
model.add(BatchNormalization())

model.add(Dense(3))
model.add(Activation('softmax'))

# compile the model
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam')


# In[ ]:


model.fit(xtrain_glove_scl, y=ytrain_enc, batch_size=64, 
          epochs=5, verbose=1, 
          validation_data=(xvalid_glove_scl, yvalid_enc))


# You need to keep on tuning the parameters of the neural network, add more layers, increase dropout to get better results. Here, I'm just showing that its fast to implement and run and gets better result than xgboost without any optimization :)
# 
# To move further, i.e. with LSTMs we need to tokenize the text data

# In[ ]:


# using keras tokenizer here
token = text.Tokenizer(num_words=None)
max_len = 70

token.fit_on_texts(list(xtrain) + list(xvalid))
xtrain_seq = token.texts_to_sequences(xtrain)
xvalid_seq = token.texts_to_sequences(xvalid)

# zero pad the sequences
xtrain_pad = sequence.pad_sequences(xtrain_seq, maxlen=max_len)
xvalid_pad = sequence.pad_sequences(xvalid_seq, maxlen=max_len)

word_index = token.word_index


# In[ ]:


# create an embedding matrix for the words we have in the dataset
embedding_matrix = np.zeros((len(word_index) + 1, 300))
for word, i in tqdm(word_index.items()):
    embedding_vector = embeddings_index.get(word)
    if embedding_vector is not None:
        embedding_matrix[i] = embedding_vector


# In[ ]:


# A simple LSTM with glove embeddings and two dense layers
model = Sequential()
model.add(Embedding(len(word_index) + 1,
                     300,

                     input_length=max_len,
                     trainable=False))
model.add(SpatialDropout1D(0.3))

model.add(Dropout(0.8))

model.add(Dense(3))
model.add(Activation('softmax'))

# In[ ]:


model.fit(xtrain_pad, y=ytrain_enc, batch_size=512, epochs=100, verbose=1, validation_data=(xvalid_pad, yvalid_enc))


# We see that the score is now less than 0.5. I ran it for many epochs without stopping at the best but you can use early stopping to stop at the best iteration. How do I use early stopping?
# 
# well, pretty easy. let's compile the model again:

# In[ ]:


# A simple LSTM with glove embeddings and two dense layers
model = Sequential()
model.add(Embedding(len(word_index) + 1,
                     300,

          verbose=1, validation_data=(xvalid_pad, yvalid_enc), callbacks=[earlystop])


# One question could be: why do i use so much dropout? Well, fit the model with no or little dropout and you will that it starts to overfit :)
# 
# Let's see if Bi-directional LSTM can give us better results. Its a piece of cake to do it with Keras :)

# Pretty close! Lets try two layers of GRU:

# Nice! Much better than what we had previously! Keep optimizing and the performance will keep improving.
# Worth trying: stemming and lemmatization. This is something I'm skipping for now.
# 
# In the Kaggle world, to get a top score you should have an ensemble of models. Let's check a little bit of ensembling!

# 
# ## Ensembling

# Few months back I made a simple ensembler but I didn't have time to develop it fully. It can be found here: https://github.com/abhishekkrthakur/pysembler . I'm going to use some part of it here:
