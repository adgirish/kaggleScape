Weighing in at 3TB total, you can see how it would be easy for me to quickly exhaust my 5TB/30-day quota scanning lots of large tables. \n\nThe `bq_helper` module simplifies the common read-only tasks we can do using the BigQuery Python client library on Kaggle and makes it a cinch to manage resource usage. This helper class works only in Kernels because we handle authentication on our side. This means you don't need to worry about anything like managing credentials or entering in credit card information to have fun learning how to work with BigQuery datasets.\n\nYou'll learn how to do the following:\n\n1. Create a `BigQueryHelper` object\n2. Understand the tables in the dataset\n3. Estimate the size of your queries before you make them\n4. Query safely, convert to `pandas.dataframe`, and visualize results\n\nBy the end of this kernel, you'll not only learn a lot about querying BigQuery datasets safely, but we'll also find out the most popular licenses used by open source projects on GitHub.

We're eager to start analyzing the GitHub BigQuery dataset to uncover insights into open source software development, but we should be careful about how much data we scan in our queries. Let's make those free 5TB count!\n\nFortunately, the `bq_helper` module gives us tools to very easily estimate the size of our queries before we get ahead of ourselves.

I know I felt confident about exploring this massive 3TB dataset knowing the functions available to me in `bq_helper` would prevent me from accidentally exceeding my quota.
