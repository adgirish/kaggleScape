        "## Introduction ##\n",
        "I previously wrote a \"naive betting analysis\" kernel (see [here][1]), wherein I explored if we'd make a profit by just betting on the favourite or the longshot outcome in each match. Turns out those strategies would only yield losses in the long run, so other smarter strategies were required to beat the bookies. In this notebook I'm exploring accumulator bets.\n",
        "\n",
        "An accumulator is when you place a single bet on the outcome of multiple matches together. Say there are 4 matches M1, M2, M3 & M4, with odds (for the favourite in each of these matches) being O1, O2, O3 & O4. Say I feel confident that the favourites are going to win these 4 matches. So instead of betting 1 dollar separately on each match, I'll place a single bet of 1 dollar on all 4 of these teams to win. (referred to as a 4-fold accumulator). The new odds O_accum=O1 X O2 X O3 X O4, & I'll receive a payout *only if* all 4 of my teams win. There is a risk involved as it takes only 1 wrong outcome to screw up your bet, but it can be used to substantially increase your payouts when you're fairly confident.\n",
        "\n",
        "Whats more, Bet365 also offers a bonus when you win your accumulator bet, based on the number of folds involved (check details [here][2]). So in my example above, if I bet 1 dollar and my 4-fold accumulator bet came true, I'd receive an additional 10% bonus, so my payout would be:\n",
        "\n",
        "P=O1 X O2 X O3 X O4 X 1.10\n",
        "\n",
        "Now that we understand how the accumulator bet works, we can get started. I'm using data only of the past 5 seasons for my analysis (i.e from 2011/12 season onwards). Based on my own knowledge of the football leagues, I picked 12 teams that were dominant over that period. I'll analyse the payouts I'd receive if I placed accumulator bets on matches of these teams. The teams I've chosen are:\n",
        "\n",
        " - Barcelona (3X winner, 2X runner-up in Spanish league)\n",
        " - Real Madrid (1X winner, 3X runner-up in Spanish league)\n",
        " - Atletico Madrid (1X winner in Spanish league)\n",
        " - Paris Saint Germain (5X winner in French league)\n",
        " - Juventus (5X winner in Italian league)\n",
        " - Bayern Munich (4X winner, 1X runner-up in German league)\n",
        " - Borussia Dortmund (1X winner, 3X runner-up in German league)\n",
        " - Celtic (5X winner in Scottish league)\n",
        " - Benfica (3X winner, 2X runner-up in Portuguese league)\n",
        " - Porto (2X winner, 1X runner-up in Portuguese league)\n",
        " - Manchester City (2X winner, 2X runner-up in EPL)\n",
        " - Arsenal (consistently finish in top 4 of the EPL every year)\n",
        "\n",
        "I'll first compute the net-payout for each team individually over the 5 seasons. I'll sort them in descending order of payout, & build a 2-fold accumulator of the best 2 teams. I'll progressively keep increasing the folds & compute the net-payout, to find the \"optimum accumulator\" that maximizes payout.\n",

        "We've just found that accumulators are a winning strategy. The best results are obtained by placing an 8-fold accumulator in every week when Juventus, Benfica, Atletico, PSG, Bayern, ManCity, Real Madrid & Arsenal are all in action. A 7-fold accumulator ignoring Arsenal from the list is not too far off either. This strategy would've given us a net profit of 219.6% (i.e more than tripling our bank balance) over 5 years, which I think is a pretty good return on investment. Note that the success rate of our bets is quite low (20.3% for 7-fold, 11.3% for 8-fold). Even so, our winnings due to the high odds & bonuses far outweigh our losses.\n",

        "I'm fairly convinced, & am going to try out this strategy at bet365.com for the remainder of the 2016-17 season. If you are heading over to create your account & start betting too, please upvote this notebook before you do so. :-)\n",
        "[Also note - the 8 fold accumulator has already been successful 3 times so far this season. Twice for league fixtures, & once when I included cup fixtures of some of these teams. Also, Celtic have won 23 of their 24 league games so far this season, so it might make sense to make it into 9 fold accumulator to milk a little more profits :-) ]\n",

        "There's still quite some room for experimentation. We could add in other teams to the mix. We can also try out better optimization & search strategies. (I've just restricted myself to greedy optimization by adding in the next-best team in each iteration)\n",

        "**Ending notes**\n",
        "\n",
        " - 219% profit might be an optimistic estimate, because I've used hindsight knowledge of teams over the past 5 seasons, & I'm assuming that they'll continue to be dominant in the near future as well. Also as teams continue to dominate, the bookmakers will realize this & progressively keep decreasing the odds on their matches.\n",
